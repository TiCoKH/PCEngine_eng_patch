## Create Syscard image
Translation use **David Shadoff** PC Engine Translate font patched SYSCARD, you found here: [SYSCARD_Translatefont](https://github.com/dshadoff/SYSCARD_Translatefont)
I used with Japanse version 3.0 patched rom, never tested with USA version. Be sure Davids IPS patches should be applied on headerless SYSCARD rom image.
